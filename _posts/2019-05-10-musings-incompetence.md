In a given limited time, we always wonder how can we excel in different areas at the same time. 

- How can I learn good writing skills ? 
- How do I learn to play a musical instrument ? 
- How can I improve managing time and be more efficient.

These questions often keeps popping up to distract the present work at hand. 

The truth is we cannot be great at everything. So, how do we deal with it ?

There are probably two ways to look at it. 

1. Never talk about it or completely ignore it. You do it poorly and pretend that you didn't do it while you were asked about it. 

2. You allot time and resources to excel with a zeal and commitment to improve it everyday. 

The second perspective will indeed let you go off the hook and get you out your comfort zone. 

And yes, you got to get out of your comfort zone to be better person everyday.
