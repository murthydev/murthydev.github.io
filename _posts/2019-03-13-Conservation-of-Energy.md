# Conservation of Energy

The law of conservation of energy (applied in physics/chemistry) states as follows 
'''
the total energy of an isolated system remains constant; it is said to be conserved over time.[1] This law means that energy can neither be created nor destroyed; rather, it can only be transformed or transferred from one form to another 
''' [1]

Does it also apply to energy states in humans (isolated systems) ???

The total energy we spent on daily activites like engaging with phone, people and talking does transform your accumulated energy.
Where do we gather energy in the first place. Do we get it from food, people or meditation. 
Anything in the excess with be thrown out or discarded.
Concentration is the key in gather energy by structured activities on a focused goal. 
The lifestyle will help to make it congenial settings for your mind to get in meditative state. 
Simplify the tasks, friends will mitigate the loss or leak of finite energy gathered everyday. 
A sufficient energy in the body by means of lifestyle will lead to  have a by product as happiness.
Now, this needs spending time with yourself to have really clear priorities for self !
